Designing a Caching library

## Description
There are 2 projects. CacheCore has the caching library, and cache is the wrapper project.
LRU and LFU cache are implemented
This is done as preparation for design interview. This is definitely not production worthy

## Installation
This is a Visual studio based solution
Open cachelib.sln using Visual studio
Currently only debug versions are buildable
Once solution is built, Run solution from visual studio, or run the built exe file

## Design description
LRU cache and LFU cache implemented.
To visualize the cache, print function is added

### Cache design
From a cache, we expect few functionalities to be exposed.
In this implementation, we have exposed most of the CRUD functionalities:
* GET
* PUT
* DELETE
* CLEAR
A cache can have different eviction policies. In this implementation, LRU and LFU is considered
A common base class for Cache is created, which is then inherited by LRU and LFU cache implementations
A factory method is exposed to instatiate a particular cache

### LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache design
Doubly Linked List is used to implement cache
In every Put, if key is not present, new node is created and pushed to back of the queue
During any get, the node is removed from existing position and pushed to back of the queue
For eviction, front of the queue is evicted
To access a particular node, a map of key to node is maintained

### LFU (Least Frequently Used) Cache design
Three DataStructures are used
1. Key - Value map
2. Key - frequency map
3. Frequency - Key map
In every Put, key - value map is updated. Similarly frequency of 1 is assigned to this
In a get, Frequency is increased by 1, and key is moved in frequency - key map from current frequency to next
In frequency-key map, multiple keys can have same frequency. Hence a queue of keys is maintained.
During eviction, we extract key from bucket having least frequency. As we extract key from a queue, least recently used key is evicted

### TTL implementation
TTL can be implemented in various ways.
One of the most popular way is reactive TTL. i.e., when user asks for a key, it's expiry is checked and deleted if required
In here, Psuedo proactive method is used. During any call to cache, we check if there are any keys to be expired and it is deleted
To achieve this one, a min heap is used where comparison is on TTL. Top of the heap denotes the node which has to be expired at the earliest
As C++ STL priority queue does not support random erase, the STL is extended to support the functionality

### Additional tools
For doubly linked list, we have created a new custom templatized class, which expose required functionalities
